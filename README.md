## Contributing  
Kind advices and contributions are always welcomed, but to avoid chaos or destabilization in existing work, we have processes that bring people in gradually. In general the process is:  

+ Find a specific **bug** you'd like to fix or a specific **feature** youâ€™d like to add (check out the issues list if to get some ideas)  
+ Fix the bug in your own clone and **ensure that it's working**   
+ Submit the change to the master branch via a **pull request**
